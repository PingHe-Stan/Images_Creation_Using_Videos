### Purpose: Create a series of images for deep learning using videos recorded on cellphone
#### Note: If you used iPhone to record the objects to be learned by CNN, then you need to convert from MOV to MP4 first before extracting images from the original videos.

- Step One: Download critical dependencies for video manipulation
If you are using Mac, please type the following command in the terminal:
brew install ffmpeg

- Step Two: After the successful installation, run the following command for video batch conversion from MOV to MP4 if you are using iPhone to make the recording.

- Step Three: If the recorded video is in MP4 format, then you are good to go.
